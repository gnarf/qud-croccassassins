# Croccassassins (A Caves of Qud reanimated Monster Mash Mod)

## Features:

* Each croccasin has a 10% chance to reveal itself as a croccassassin when you pick it up.
* Oops! All crocassassins - Options menu option to make it 100% chance
* Can recruit crocassassins to your party if you are high enough reputation with unshelled reptiles.

## Ideas/TODO
* [ ] really let the "sass" speak up
* [ ] maybe add an axe "bite" to the normal croccasin
* [ ] Add some guarnteed croccassassins to certain chests (snapjaw forts?)
* [ ] Stretch: dynamic quest to place them in a different chest? (snapjaw forts?)
