# Croccassassins (A Caves of Qud reanimated Monster Mash Mod)

## Features (somewhat spoilery)

* Each croccasin has a 10% chance to reveal itself as a croccassassin when you pick it up.
* Oops! All crocassassins - Options menu option to make it 100% chance
* If you are friendly enough with crocs, you can discover a quest!
* Can recruit crocassassins to your party if you are high enough reputation with unshelled reptiles.
* Adds shoe racks in random places, highly likely to contain croccasins

## Ideas/TODO

* [ ] really let the "sass" speak up
