# Croccassassins (A Caves of Qud reanimated Monster Mash Mod)

## Ideas/TODO
* [x] on take, spawn 1-2 crocs, maybe higher level in higer tier zones?, maybe chance, maybe 100% 
* [x] maybe have them join "as a party member" if you're Loved by unshelled,
* [ ] really let the "sass" speak up
* [ ] maybe add an axe "bite" to the normal shoe
* [x] Oops! All crocassassins.
* [ ] Add some guarnteed croccassassins to certain chests (snapjaw forts?)
* [ ] Stretch: dynamic quest to place them in a different chest? (snapjaw forts?)
